# MySQL-JDBC-Data-Transaction-Test-and-Implementation
Project Implemented during Mysql Studies with JavaEE/JDBC to Test and Run a SQL Transaction Implementation with JDBC API Classes (Statement())) and its Methods (.executeUpdate()). The Program also implements a returnProperty method in its DB class in order to Read and Load the db.properties txt File throughout FileInput Stream and Properties Class for the JDBC API Connection. Also, it implements  a custom Exception DBIntegrityException (extending RuntimeException for faster development purposes) , which is set to treat usual DataBase Integrity Exceptions at possible data Deletion/Update processes inside the Transaction (e.g a Bank Transaction Code), for instance the deletion of a category which is connected through a foreign key to one or more products at a product table, which foreshadows a FK error at the Database
